## Overview

A freelance Marketplace platform is an online platform where businesses can find and hire individual contractors to do some work remotely. The platform acts as an intermediary providing a safe and convenient way to contract remote experts for one-time projects.
The proposed system is a centralized Freelance Marketplace which connects employers with freelancers who can perform some work remotely or in person if necessary. This project aims to develop a freelance marketplace where not only an employer could post a project for bidding but a freelancer could also offer his/her services for buyers.
